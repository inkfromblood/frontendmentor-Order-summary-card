## My process
This time I broke things down with a written outline first. That really helped.
I think I spent a lot of time trying to get things coded cleanly, rather than just doing what I could to match the design.
Some parts were simpler solutions than I was trying to make them.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
THINGS I'M NOT SURE OF:

Hero Image border radius - I had to apply the border radius to both the DIV and the IMG. Is there a way to do this just once?

There is also 3.600 white line at the bottom - unsure of how it got there...setting display: block; removed it.
But I just dont' know why that happens. (similar issue in the NFT card challenge)

For the 'annual plan' and 'price' text, I want them so the top of ANNUAL PLAN is perfectly aligned to the top edge of the music icon,
and the bototm of the price is perfectly aligned to the the bottom edge of the music icon.
Right now I could only figure out how to fudge with adding a bottom margin to the h2 - but that feels like a sloppy way of accomplishing this.
